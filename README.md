This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Create New React Project

1. Create an empty directory for the project and change directory into it
2. Run command to create the React application

```
npx create-react-app client
```
where 'client' is the application name

3. Test newly created application by changing directory into the app name and run the command

```
npm start
```

4. If the application starts in the browser, the application setup is successful.  Now edit the app.js and remove the boiler plate code wich is the '<header>' tag

5. Download bootstrap library from bootstrapcdn.com.  As of this writing, you copy and paste the link below into the index.html

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

6. Then copy/paste the script tab above the closing body tag

```
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-B4gt1jrGC7Jh4AgTPSdUtOBvfO8shuf57BaghqFfPlYxofvL8/KUEfYiJOMMV+rV" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

7. Test the above links but creating a button component in App.js

```
<button className='btn btn-primary'>Submit</button>
```
8. Install the React Router library.  This allows page navigation

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

9. Remove the import of logo line in App.js.  Not using that anymore.  Should be located in line 2

```
import logo from './logo.svg';
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
